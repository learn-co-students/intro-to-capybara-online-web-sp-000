#./app.rb is our main application file, defining the controller that will power this web application.
# We create an Application class and inherit from Sinatra::Base to give it all of the web superpowers needed to transform
# the standard Ruby class into a Sinatra controller.

#Within our Application controller, we use the Sinatra DSL to create a GET route at the / URL.
# We tell our application to respond to HTTP GET requests to / by rendering the designated ERB template or HTML.
class Application < Sinatra::Base
  # Write your code here!
  get '/' do
    erb :index #tells the application to render, or deliver to the user's browser,
               # the file in views/index.erb. This is a Sinatra-provided functionality that renders ERB templates located in the views directory
  end

  # New route to respond to the form submission
  post '/greet' do
    erb :greet
  end
#Using the Sinatra post method, we create a response for requests to POST '/greet'. That response should be the HTML contained in the views/greet.erb template,
